# Example indicator definitions for the OSINT warning dashboard.
# Each indicator has an ID, the PIR it supports, whether it is associated
# with the most‑likely or most‑dangerous course of action, a descriptive
# statement, the data feeds that might produce evidence for the indicator,
# and a simple threshold definition. These definitions are deliberately
# minimal; analysts can extend them with more sophisticated logic.
